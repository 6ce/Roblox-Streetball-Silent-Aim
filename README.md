# Streetball-Silent-Aim:

Due to the GUI not being ready yet, I've decided to just release the Aimbot for free now, GUI coming soon :).

# Usage

Requires Synapse, Script-Ware (Windows & Mac most likely), Fluxus, or KRNL

```
loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/carolesdaughter/Streetball-Silent-Aim/main/Aimbot.lua"))()
```
