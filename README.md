# Streetball-Silent-Aim:

Due to the GUI not being ready yet, I've decided to just release the Aimbot for free now, GUI coming soon :).

# Usage

Just jump when you're in footing, will automatically change power for you, and it "spoofs" a click (just shows someone who's PVEyeing you that you clicked)

Requires Synapse, Script-Ware (Windows & Mac most likely), Fluxus, or KRNL

I'd recommend using the loadstring incase an update is pushed out for the aimbot:
```
-- // due to high ping making autopower useless sometimes, ive added a toggle for it if you'd like to disable it
getgenv().AutoPower = true -- // change to false to disable automatic power changing

loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/carolesdaughter/Streetball-Silent-Aim/main/SilentAimbot.lua"))()"))()
```
