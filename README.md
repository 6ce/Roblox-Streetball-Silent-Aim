# Streetball-Silent-Aim:

Originally when I first made this, I announced the release of a GUI for Streetball, due to the owner of the server I announced it in selling already-released scripts, I've decided to distance myself from that & the GUI will most likely not be made, this repository will be edited if it indeed does.

# Usage

Just jump when you're in footing, will automatically change power for you, and it "spoofs" a click (just shows someone who's PVEyeing you that you clicked)

Requires Synapse, Script-Ware (Windows & Mac most likely), Fluxus, or KRNL

I'd recommend using the loadstring incase an update is pushed out for the aimbot:
```
-- // due to high ping making autopower useless sometimes, ive added a toggle for it if you'd like to disable it
getgenv().AutoPower = true -- // change to false to disable automatic power changing

loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/carolesdaughter/Streetball-Silent-Aim/main/SilentAimbot.lua"))()
```
